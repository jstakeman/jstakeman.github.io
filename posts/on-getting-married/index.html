    <h2>On Getting Married (part 1)</h2>
    <p>I never thought much about getting married when I was younger.  I had decided that I was pro-marriage, but that was as far as that thought process went. I never fantasized about my wedding(which ended up being awesome). I never cut out clips of magazines or prayed for the day when my wife would arrive.</p>

<p>Marriage was, for lack of a better term, transparent. I definitely imagined fatherhood, but in those moments the wife was always conveniently out of frame.  When I imagined childbirth, it always carried the cliche moment of her hand squeezing the life out of mine. Her face, though, was always obscured, like a neighbor in a Tim Allen sitcom.</p>

<p>This never bothered me. I never tried to reverse engineer it from the images of my dream children's faces.  I was never curious, which is weird for me.  That's the power of transparency. It is the naturalization of obfuscation. It is so powerful that it erases the very notion of focusing on it.</p>

<p>My wife is no longer transparent. I can see her face now. It's gently squished into the pillow and lit by the spill of my laptop screen. Her face has been remastered in all my dream reruns. Now I only have difficulty imagining it not being there.</p>
