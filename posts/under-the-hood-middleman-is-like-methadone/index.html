    <h2>Under the hood: Middleman is like Methadone</h2>
    <p>I am fascinated by content management systems. I have toyed around with: Wordpress, Movable Type, Drupal, Cascade, and others that I've forgotten. For work, I get to hack on Blackboard Learn and Moodle nearly every day. Years ago I even got to work on a cutting edge experimental scholarly digital publishing platform called <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu">Scalar</a>.  By "work on" I mean beta test and pitch a few wireframes to some very patient developers who then smiled, nodded, and patted me on the head. Check it out, the product is much better off without my suggestions.</p>

<p>I've even tried my hand at writing a few of my own.  My efforts generally came to an end once my hack job zombie creation proved that it could shuffle.</p>

<p>Writing your own blogging engine is a good early programming task.  It is very easy to be excited by it at the beginning.  They are easy to understand and produce a couple of interesting wrinkles to code around.  This practice has the romantic appeal of a carpenter making his own tools.  It has a seductive allure. It is a lumbersexual-Protestant-work-ethic-pulling-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps wrapper for staring at your belly button.</p>

<p>Staring at your belly button is fantastic. My mother confirms that I used to spend hours folded up investigating mine.  At the right age, this narcissism is adorable and probably an important Freudian stage of development.  I still think it is a great learning-to-program project, but it also probably needs to stop at some point.</p>

<p>I have spent countless hours fiddling with tools to amplify my voice, when I would have been better off working on things for that voice to say.  At some point, preparation becomes procrastination.</p>

<p>I spent the better part of a week trying to figure out the perfect platform on which to run this site.  I even considered diving into the world of graph databases just to stay current.  In the end, I realized that what I wanted was to write every day.  The writing was the focus on this particular project. Learning a new technology was not.</p>

<p>I drew some inspiration from this <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/free-static-sites-middleman-github/">Sitepoint article</a> by <a href="http://benjamintan.io/">Benjamin Tan</a> on <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> has been a great way to start quickly and doesn't feel completely prepackaged either. I hope it breaks my cycle of technology-for-its-own-sake addiction by gently scratching my New Englander itch to build a site out of a tree I felled with my bare hands.</p>
