    <h2>Hobbies: Being Car People (part 1)</h2>
    <p><img alt="Ill Portent" src="/images/meltedCables_01.jpg" />
We are not short on hobbies. And yetâ€¦</p>

<p>Crawling on my belly through the internet, I came across <a href="http://www.apidaonline.com/index.php/home/item/5-things-no-one-tells-you-about-owning-a-used-luxury-car">this man's account</a> of buying a cheap older luxury car.  This led to more articles and a brief dip into Internet car culture.  It turns out that the vehicles we drive can be repaired at home.  It is now my understanding that much in the same way that meals served in restaurants may also be prepared in a small apartment kitchen, automotive repairs are something that mere mortals are capable of.</p>

<p>With no garage and only minimal car repair knowledge, we decided to be car people. Things started out great because neither of our cars needed anything done to them.</p>

<p>We were riding high on our acute lack of failure when a friend's old Izuzu Trooper died. She had left the light on and thought it just needed a jump. We could help because we had decided to be car people! My wife even had jumper cables.</p>

<p>It was late and already dark outside.  The cars were mirror images of each other, and our cables wouldn't reach.</p>

<p>"We'll just push your car down the driveway a bit and back the other one in", I proclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why don't we just drive up on the other side of the car?", my wife wisely asked.</p>

<p>Just days after deciding to be car people, she was already far ahead of me.</p>

<p>I've jumped a car before. My car. Sitting outside for months in the desert sun had drained it of its will to live. This was years ago, but I remembered the basic theory.</p>

<p>"Positive to Positive. Negative to Ground"</p>

<p>I said this in a way that suggested it was the truth.  I believed it myself, especially after covertly checking the Internet.</p>

<p>Cables were clipped.  We waited, but the car wouldn't start.</p>

<p>"Maybe that isn't actually grounding anything." My black jumper cable was clamped on to some suspicious looking part of the frame.</p>

<p>"Let's try the engine block."</p>

<p>Sparks immediately erupted from the cables.</p>

<p>My memory of a successfully jumped car did not include sparks flying.</p>

<p>We tried several other variations, but they all resulted in sparks and smoke.  Finally, the sparks subsided, and we thought we were on to something.</p>

<p>The something we were on to was the jumper cables melting their protective coating straight off.</p>

<p>I must admit I had one rather gallant moment of dramatically stripping of my shirt in order to disconnect everything. There may have even been a glisten of sweat before I realized that I ought to go back to the gym and put my thankfully-not-that-smoking t-shirt back on.</p>

<p>Down but not defeated, we returned home and left the smoldering jumper cables in the dirt.</p>

<p>We came back in the morning armed with longer, higher gauge, Home Depot approved cables.</p>

<p>More sparks!</p>

<p>We consulted the Internet and the instructions. Our first client was about to call an actual expert. Suddenly, my wife stopped us in the middle of attempt number embarrassing-number and pointed to the dead battery.</p>

<p>Why use red and black, when the battery was also conveniently marked with a mysterious "+" and "-".</p>

<p><img alt="Thanks everlast" src="/images/meltedCables_02.jpg" />
They were small, subtle, and unmistakeable.</p>

<p>Cables were reapplied, but this time there were no sparks and an all too happy to start engine.</p>

<p>And so ended our first adventure in our quest to become car people.</p>

<p>Let us not judge battery terminals by their color but by the content of their character (and associated symbols).</p>
