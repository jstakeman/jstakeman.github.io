    <h2>On Cooking: Biscuits and Family</h2>
    <p><img alt="Finished" src="/images/mixedBiscuits.jpg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/southern-biscuits-recipe.html#lightbox-recipe-video"><em>The Dough Also Rises</em></a> is my favorite episode of my favorite cooking show, <em>Good Eats</em>.  The host, Alton Brown, makes biscuits side by side with his grandmother.  She seems a little suspicious of the cameras or why anyone would want to film her making biscuits and the whole segment is adorable.</p>

<p>I never cooked anything with either of my grandmothers.  They were both New York City women and neither of them cooked well or often.  I never grew up with recipes that had been handed down through generations. I didn't have close ties with my extended family. I never yearned to learn an aunt's secret recipe for something or other.</p>

<p>I loved being in the kitchen as a kid because that's where the action was.  I have many fond memories "helping" my parents in the kitchen, but our meals came from recipes in books, or on boxes, and eventually the internet.  The continuous process of discovering new family food allergies also meant that our cooking was in constant flux.</p>

<p>I love the interdisciplinary nature of cooking and its intersectionality.  Its ubiquitous mix of chemistry, culture, history, and creativity make it a fantastic lens for viewing a big complex world. It just doesn't seem to work much of its magic on me.  My kitchens have been stripped of sentimentality and steeped in postmodern appropriation.  My wife's, however, have not.</p>

<p>Her family gatherings are complete with familiar smells from the kitchen and familiar tastes at the table.  Certain dishes are synonymous with certain family members and certain holidays.  Refried black beans, a staple in her country, are infused not just with garlic and onions, but with politics and intergenerational preferences.</p>

<p>Our kitchen seems destined for a blend rich history and irreverent remix.</p>

<p>My current biscuits don't drift much from Alton Brown's grandmother's.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 cup of flour</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon of butter flavored shortening</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
  <li>1 dash of baking soda</li>
  <li>1 healthy pinch of salt</li>
  <li>1/2 cup of cold buttermilk</li>
</ul>

<p>I am very lactose intolerant and still have some reservations about the buttermilkâ€¦</p>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.</li>
  <li>Mix all the dry ingredients go together with the fats.</li>
  <li>Work them together rubbing the mixture between your fingers until it feels crumbly like grits.</li>
  <li>Make a well in the center then add the buttermilk.</li>
  <li>Stir it quickly, while avoiding overworking the dough.</li>
  <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll it out with a floured rolling pin.</li>
  <li>Cut out biscuits with a biscuit cutter.</li>
  <li>Place biscuits, just touching, into a cast iron skillet or whatever.</li>
  <li>Bake until they are golden brown (15 minutes-ish depending on the thickness)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now if you don't have a grandmother to walk you through this I have some <strong>very</strong> recently acquired wisdom for you.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have more flour than you need. Flour is fickle. It both compacts and absorbs humidity. It's hard to tell how much you actually need. If you run out of flour your dough will be a sticky mess, and you'll have to plead for your wife to bring you more before you cover your entire kitchen in little blobs of dough.  If she can only find whole wheat flour, by all means use it. It will make the biscuits have a slightly nutty flavor and bring your sticky misery to an end.</li>
  <li>Take off your wedding band before you start unless you want to be reminded of that time you made biscuits every time you idly spin it around your finger and more dough comes out.</li>
</ol>

My goal of learning how to cook without making a mess is still very much in process</p>

<p>These biscuits formed a core of this morning's brunch:</p>

<p><img alt="Finished" src="/images/mixedBiscuits.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Cuban black beans (because of our Cuban restaurant date last week)</li>
  <li>leftover Easter pulled pork (because that's totally a thing)</li>
  <li>biscuits (obviously)</li>
  <li>a fried egg (because brunch)</li>
</ul>

<p>This final picture was taken with a real camera because I still <strong>hate</strong> my camera phone.</p>
