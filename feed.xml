    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by content management systems. I have toyed around with: Wordpress, Movable Type, Drupal, Cascade, and others that I've forgotten. For work, I get to hack on Blackboard Learn and Moodle nearly every day. Years ago I even got to work on a cutting edge experimental scholarly digital publishing platform called &lt;a href="http://scalar.usc.edu"&gt;Scalar&lt;/a&gt;.  By "work on" I mean beta test and pitch a few wireframes to some very patient developers who then smiled, nodded, and patted me on the head. Check it out, the product is much better off without my suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've even tried my hand at writing a few of my own.  My efforts generally came to an end once my hack job zombie creation proved that it could shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing your own blogging engine is a good early programming task.  It is very easy to be excited by it at the beginning.  They are easy to understand and produce a couple of interesting wrinkles to code around.  This practice has the romantic appeal of a carpenter making his own tools.  It has a seductive allure. It is a lumbersexual-Protestant-work-ethic-pulling-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps wrapper for staring at your belly button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staring at your belly button is fantastic. My mother confirms that I used to spend hours folded up investigating mine.  At the right age, this narcissism is adorable and probably an important Freudian stage of development.  I still think it is a great learning-to-program project, but it also probably needs to stop at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent countless hours fiddling with tools to amplify my voice, when I would have been better off working on things for that voice to say.  At some point, preparation becomes procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of a week trying to figure out the perfect platform on which to run this site.  I even considered diving into the world of graph databases just to stay current.  In the end, I realized that what I wanted was to write every day.  The writing was the focus on this particular project. Learning a new technology was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drew some inspiration from this &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/free-static-sites-middleman-github/"&gt;Sitepoint article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://benjamintan.io/"&gt;Benjamin Tan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; has been a great way to start quickly and doesn't feel completely prepackaged either. I hope it breaks my cycle of technology-for-its-own-sake addiction by gently scratching my New Englander itch to build a site out of a tree I felled with my bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; is like Methadone. (They did not use this tagline)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I never thought much about getting married when I was younger.  I had decided that I was pro-marriage, but that was as far as that thought process went. I never fantasized about my wedding (which ended up being awesome). I never cut out clips of magazines or prayed for the day when my wife would arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marriage was, for lack of a better term, transparent. I definitely imagined fatherhood, but in those moments the wife was always conveniently out of frame.  When I imagined childbirth, it always carried the cliche moment of her hand squeezing the life out of mine. Her face, though, was always obscured, like a neighbor in a Tim Allen sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This never bothered me. I never tried to reverse engineer it from the images of my dream children's faces.  I was never curious, which is weird for me.  That's the power of transparency. It is the naturalization of obfuscation. It is so powerful that it erases the very notion of focusing on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife is no longer transparent. I can see her face now. It's gently squished into the pillow and lit by the spill of my laptop screen. Her face has been remastered in all my dream reruns. Now I only have difficulty imagining it not being there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes staring blankly into the void of the internet produces interesting results. It's like fishing. There are days when you sit contemplatively looking out on the placid waters (drunk), and there are days when you reel in something worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.instastock.co"&gt;Instastock&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively new project from &lt;a href="http://www.dylansimel.com/"&gt;Dylan Simel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He joins the growing number of people and sites giving royalty free stock photos away… for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unsplash.com"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; and other sites have been invaluable to me in my day job, where I try to make a lot of online courses less ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dylan's work though interests me on a number of levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I admire his discipline of adding an image a day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The glimpses of North Carolina and his travels offer valuable and different perspectives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is all shot with his iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After learning about his site, I immediately sat up from my internet fishing and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decided that I need that discipline of doing something every day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;realized that my unique contexts and circumstances might offer valuable and different perspectives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remembered that I hate taking pictures with my Galaxy S4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for that &lt;a href="http://www.dylansimel.com/"&gt;Dylan Simel&lt;/a&gt;… thanks&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="This Bag Torment/Relieves Me" src="/images/bag.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Walgreen's plastic bag entered our lives during a particularly windy day last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It greets me every day. Sometimes waving. Sometimes more lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has caused brainstorming sessions about possible ways to remove it. It has made me want to buy one of those expensive ladders from Costco. It has survived being pelted by rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife thinks it mocks us. I think it gives us a gentle reminder about our place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its humble indifference is a testament to the importance of acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a guerilla sculpture about the excesses of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a challenge without a particularly compelling need for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a constant reminder of how nice it would be to have that expensive Costco ladder. I mean really for only a couple hundred bucks I could snag that bag and also dust those high up walls in our apartment. 30 minutes of manual labor bliss is a bargain at half the price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When am I supposed to feel like an adult?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A week after a wonderful wedding reception, secluded in a tiny Colorado town for a miniature honeymoon, I asked my new wife an important question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When are we supposed to feel like adults?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hadn't happened yet.  I thought the wedding might do it.  There were vows, pictures, delicious cakes, and smiling faces.  None of that resulted in a feeling of adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly feel like I know "How to Adult". That training began early. I am an only child. I never understood that I was a kid because there weren't other models of identity available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think that I do a passable job of impersonating an adult when people are watching, I definitely have impostor syndrome.  I'm not afraid that someone will find out that I'm not an actual adult. That would be a relief. Adulting is a lot of work.  It is exhausting. I'm glad that I don't have to do it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife's response was…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think when we have kids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sense.  Babies are clearly not adults.  When changing one's diaper, it is also very clear that one is not a baby.  That would sort of make us feel like an adult by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we'll feel like adults when none of the other options makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
