    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="This Bag Torment/Relieves Me" src="images/bag.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Walgreen's plastic bag entered our lives during a particularly windy day last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It greets me every day. Sometimes waving. Sometimes more lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has caused brainstorming sessions about possible ways to remove it. It has made me want to buy one of those expensive ladders from Costco. It has survived being pelted by rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife thinks it mocks us. I think it gives us a gentle reminder about our place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its humble indifference is a testament to the importance of acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a guerilla sculpture about the excesses of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a challenge without a particularly compelling need for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a constant reminder of how nice it would be to have that expensive Costco ladder. I mean really for only a couple hundred bucks I could snag that bag and also dust those high up walls in our apartment. 30 minutes of manual labor bliss is a bargain at half the price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A week after a wonderful wedding reception, secluded in a tiny Colorado town for a miniature honeymoon, I asked my new wife an important question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When are we supposed to feel like adults?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hadn't happened yet.  I thought the wedding might do it.  There were vows, pictures, delicous cakes, and smiling faces.  None of that resulted in a feeling of adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly feel like I know "How to Adult". That training began early. I am an only child. I never really understood that I was a kid, because there weren't other models of identity available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think that I do a passable job of impersonating an adult when people are watching, I definitely have imposter syndrome.  I'm not afraid that someone will find out that I'm not an actual adult. That would be a relief. Adulting is a lot of work.  It is exhuasting. I'm glad that I don't have to do it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife's response wasâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think when we have kids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sense.  Babies are clearly not adults.  When changing one's diaper it is also very clear that one is not a baby.  That would sort of make us feel like an adult by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we'll feel like adults when none of the other options makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
