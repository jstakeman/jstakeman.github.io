    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A week after a wonderful wedding reception, secluded in a tiny Colorado town for a miniature honeymoon, I asked my new wife an important question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When are we supposed to feel like adults?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hadn't happened yet.  I thought the wedding might do it.  There were vows, pictures, delicous cakes, and smiling faces.  None of that resulted in a feeling of adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly feel like I know "How to Adult". That training began early. I am an only child. I never really understood that I was a kid, because there weren't other models of identity available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think that I do a passable job of impersonating an adult when people are watching, I definitely have imposter syndrome.  I'm not afraid that someone will find out that I'm not an actual adult. That would be a relief. Adulting is a lot of work.  It is exhuasting. I'm glad that I don't have to do it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife's response wasâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think when we have kids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sense.  Babies are clearly not adults.  When changing one's diaper it is also very clear that one is not a baby.  That would sort of make us feel like an adult by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we'll feel like adults when none of the other options makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
