We are not short on hobbies. And yet…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crawling on my belly through the internet I came across &lt;a href="http://www.apidaonline.com/index.php/home/item/5-things-no-one-tells-you-about-owning-a-used-luxury-car"&gt;this man's account&lt;/a&gt; of buying a cheap older luxury car.  This led to more articles and a brief dip into internet car culture.  It turns out that the vehicles we drive can be operated on by hand at home.  It is now my understanding that much in the same way that meals served in restaurants may also prepared at home, automotive repair is something that mere mortals are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no garage and only minimal car repair knowledge, we decided to be car people. Things started out great because neither of our cars needed anything done to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolstered by this lack of failure when a friend's old Izuzu trooper died because she left the light on we jumped at the opportunity to jump her car.  My wife even had jumper cables already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was late and already dark outside.  The cars were mirror images of each other, and our cables wouldn't reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We'll just push your car down the driveway a bit and back the other one in" I proclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Why don't we just drive up on the other side of the car" my wife wisely asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just days after deciding to be car people she was already far ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've jumped a car before. My car. Sitting outside for months in the desert sun had drained it of its will to live. This was years ago, but I remembered the basic theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Positive to positive. Negative to Ground"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said this in a way that suggested it was the truth.  I believed myself, especially after covertly checking the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cables were clipped.  We waited, but the car wouldn't start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Maybe that isn't actually grounding anything." My black jumper cable was clamped on to some suspicious looking part of the frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Let's try the engine block."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sparks immediately erupted from the cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My memory of a successfully jumped car did not include sparks flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried several other variations, but they all resulted in sparks and smoke.  Finally, the sparks subsided, and we thought we were on to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The something we were on to was the jumper cables melting their protective coating straight off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit I had one rather gallant moment of dramatically stripping of my shirt in order to disconnect everything. There may have even been a glisten of sweat before I realized that I ought to go back to the gym and put my thankfully not that smoking t-shirt back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down but not defeated, we returned home and left the smoldering jumper cables in the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned in the morning armed with longer, higher gauge cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More sparks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted the Internet, the instructions and were about to call in experts. My wife stopped us in the middle of attempt number embarrassing-number. And pointed to the dead battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why use red and black, when the battery also conveniently was marked with a mysterious "+" and "-".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Thanks everlast" src="/images/images/meltedCables_02" /&gt;
They were small, subtle, and unmistakeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cables were reapplied, but this time there were no sparks and an all to happy to start engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so ended our first adventure in our quest to become car people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us not judge battery terminals by their color but by the contents of their associated symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was very excited to launch back into writing this morning, but when I went to the site there was only an error.  My browser couldn't find incrayon.com DNS record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the hosting to see if they were doing all right and Github reported no problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered that I registered my domain through &lt;a href="http://www.namecheap.com"&gt;namecheap.com&lt;/a&gt; and a quick google search &lt;a href="http://status.namecheap.com/archives/19240"&gt;revealed this update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNS servers under attack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd never thought of that aspect of picking my registrar and DNS provider.  Does anyone keep a record of how often and how successfully they get attacked?  Web hosts often tout u their uptime, but I'd never thought to look for that with DNS services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any recommendations or strategies they use when looking at this sort of stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On Cooking: Biscuits and Family</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Finished" src="/images/mixedBiscuits.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/southern-biscuits-recipe.html#lightbox-recipe-video"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dough Also Rises&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite episode of my favorite cooking show, &lt;em&gt;Good Eats&lt;/em&gt;.  The host, Alton Brown, makes biscuits side by side with his grandmother.  She seems a little suspicious of the cameras or why anyone would want to film her making biscuits and the whole segment is adorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never cooked anything with either of my grandmothers.  They were both New York City women and neither of them cooked well or often.  I never grew up with recipes that had been handed down through generations. I didn't have close ties with my extended family. I never yearned to learn an aunt's secret recipe for something or other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved being in the kitchen as a kid because that's where the action was.  I have many fond memories "helping" my parents in the kitchen, but our meals came from recipes in books, or on boxes, and eventually the internet.  The continuous process of discovering new family food allergies also meant that our cooking was in constant flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the interdisciplinary nature of cooking and its intersectionality.  Its ubiquitous mix of chemistry, culture, history, and creativity make it a fantastic lens for viewing a big complex world. It just doesn't seem to work much of its magic on me.  My kitchens have been stripped of sentimentality and steeped in postmodern appropriation.  My wife's, however, have not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her family gatherings are complete with familiar smells from the kitchen and familiar tastes at the table.  Certain dishes are synonymous with certain family members and certain holidays.  Refried black beans, a staple in her country, are infused not just with garlic and onions, but with politics and intergenerational preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our kitchen seems destined for a blend rich history and irreverent remix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current biscuits don't drift much from Alton Brown's grandmother's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup of flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon of butter flavored shortening&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon of butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons of sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons of baking powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 dash of baking soda&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 healthy pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup of cold buttermilk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very lactose intolerant and still have some reservations about the buttermilk…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mix all the dry ingredients go together with the fats.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work them together rubbing the mixture between your fingers until it feels crumbly like grits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a well in the center then add the buttermilk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir it quickly, while avoiding overworking the dough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll it out with a floured rolling pin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut out biscuits with a biscuit cutter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place biscuits, just touching, into a cast iron skillet or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake until they are golden brown (15 minutes-ish depending on the thickness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Step 1" src="/images/mixedBiscuits_01.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Step 2" src="/images/mixedBiscuits_02.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you don't have a grandmother to walk you through this I have some &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; recently acquired wisdom for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have more flour than you need. Flour is fickle. It both compacts and absorbs humidity. It's hard to tell how much you actually need. If you run out of flour your dough will be a sticky mess, and you'll have to plead for your wife to bring you more before you cover your entire kitchen in little blobs of dough.  If she can only find whole wheat flour, by all means use it. It will make the biscuits have a slightly nutty flavor and bring your sticky misery to an end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take off your wedding band before you start unless you want to be reminded of that time you made biscuits every time you idly spin it around your finger and more dough comes out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Step 3" src="/images/mixedBiscuits_03.jpg" /&gt;
My goal of learning how to cook without making a mess is still very much in process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These biscuits formed a core of this morning's brunch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Finished" src="/images/mixedBiscuits.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cuban black beans (because of our Cuban restaurant date last week)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leftover Easter pulled pork (because that's totally a thing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;biscuits (obviously)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a fried egg (because brunch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final picture was taken with a real camera because I still &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; my camera phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Where I grew up, being of service is the primary measure of value.  This sentiment works for both people and things.  A pristine gold encrusted shovel locked behind glass is not valuable.  A genius spinster writing her days away only gains value once her work is published.  Industry for its own sake is vanity. These are the rules laid out by a radical, and possibly militant, pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most productive creative people I know are driven primarily by personal passion. Some are escaping demons, others seem to produce almost by reflex. That powerful passion though is the most pervasive throughline in my admittedly somewhat limited sample set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These beautiful, creative minds do their work because it is important to them.  That internal engine leads them to do great things if only to scratch that itch of theirs.  It effortlessly fuels late night hours or manic sprints and bursts of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine sputters.  At every step along the way the dampers of "so what" choke off the oxygen.  I have literally worked for free sweeping out trailers while working for a man who would email us about that football team in Denver he owned. There was no question in my mind in picking up that broom, but I sometimes have to build myself up to sitting down in a comfy chair with a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives? That makes zero sense to me and yet it is often my reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must be a better way. Some sort of Nash equilibrium where the optimal path is service to oneself and to others.  I stumble across it sometimes but couldn't point it out to you on a map.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Consumption is very easy.  We start as infants.  Capitalism wouldn't be quite so appealing if it were hard to get people to buy things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think, that in order for there to be some balance, the creation of things would be a comparable process.  How else would we find some much to consume if it wasn't also being created?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this all just a side effect of the Industrial Age?  Did we use to be a world of creators and consumers in equal measure?  Did the steam engine tilt the scales so far in the direction of creation that it perversely made it harder to create things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes find myself staring at media that I have no interest in.  Last night I spent an hour listening to Friends with my eyes closed.  Surely a few minutes of typing would be easier than that particular endurance test.  Listening to the holiday armadillo for the umpteenth time can not be an easier task than writing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet….&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Under the hood: Middleman is like Methadone</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by content management systems. I have toyed around with: Wordpress, Movable Type, Drupal, Cascade, and others that I've forgotten. For work, I get to hack on Blackboard Learn and Moodle nearly every day. Years ago I even got to work on a cutting edge experimental scholarly digital publishing platform called &lt;a href="http://scalar.usc.edu"&gt;Scalar&lt;/a&gt;.  By "work on" I mean beta test and pitch a few wireframes to some very patient developers who then smiled, nodded, and patted me on the head. Check it out, the product is much better off without my suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've even tried my hand at writing a few of my own.  My efforts generally came to an end once my hack job zombie creation proved that it could shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing your own blogging engine is a good early programming task.  It is very easy to be excited by it at the beginning.  They are easy to understand and produce a couple of interesting wrinkles to code around.  This practice has the romantic appeal of a carpenter making his own tools.  It has a seductive allure. It is a lumbersexual-Protestant-work-ethic-pulling-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps wrapper for staring at your belly button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staring at your belly button is fantastic. My mother confirms that I used to spend hours folded up investigating mine.  At the right age, this narcissism is adorable and probably an important Freudian stage of development.  I still think it is a great learning-to-program project, but it also probably needs to stop at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent countless hours fiddling with tools to amplify my voice, when I would have been better off working on things for that voice to say.  At some point, preparation becomes procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of a week trying to figure out the perfect platform on which to run this site.  I even considered diving into the world of graph databases just to stay current.  In the end, I realized that what I wanted was to write every day.  The writing was the focus on this particular project. Learning a new technology was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drew some inspiration from this &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/free-static-sites-middleman-github/"&gt;Sitepoint article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://benjamintan.io/"&gt;Benjamin Tan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; has been a great way to start quickly and doesn't feel completely prepackaged either. I hope it breaks my cycle of technology-for-its-own-sake addiction by gently scratching my New Englander itch to build a site out of a tree I felled with my bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; is like Methadone. (They did not use this tagline)&lt;/p&gt;
